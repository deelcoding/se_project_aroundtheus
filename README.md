**Sprints 5 and 6 Code**

Within Sprint 5, I have added functionality with the Edit Profile and Add Image button, as well as, functionality for the photo preview.

Within Sprint 6, I have added validation for the Edit Profile and Add Image forms. It now has parameters for the information that is entered and will give error messages if it does not meet the requirements. Within this sprint, there was code added to close out of the pop-ups using the "Escape" key and clicking outside of the pop-up.

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. This is to show how websites respond to different screen sizes. This project covers design layouts such as grid and flexbox, while using media queuries to size the page appropriately for different screen sizes.
